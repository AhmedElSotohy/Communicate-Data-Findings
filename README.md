## by (Ahmed ElSotohy)


## Dataset

> This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. This data [dictionary](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key%3D0AllIqIyvWZdadDd5NTlqZ1pBMHlsUjdrOTZHaVBuSlE%26usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&ust=1554484977407000) explains the variables in the data set

## Summary of Findings

> Through exploration phase I found that there was a negative relationship between BorrowerAPR and LoanOriginalAmount, as BorrowerAPR decreases with higher loans. Also, I found a positive relationship between LoanOriginalAmount and StatedMonthlyIncome. Later we came to observe that higher ProsperRating results in lower BorrowerAPR, and a higher loan amount, while lower ProsperRating has higher APR, and smaller loan amounts. In addition those with a high ProsperRating earn more monthly. 

## Key Insights for Presentation

> In the presentation I focused on BorrowerAPR and how other factors such as Loan Amount, ProsperRating, and Term could affect it.
> I started by plotting the distribution of BorrowerAPR and Monthly Income, and then plotted Loan Amount by BorrowerAPR & Loan Amount. And then BorrowerAPR by Rating and Term. And finally, Rating by Loan Amount and Term.
